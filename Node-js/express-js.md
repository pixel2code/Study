# Express.js

In Node.js it's possible to make a HTTP server, using the native `http` module, as we saw in the Node.js crash course video. However, this is rarely used in practice. Instead, we'll use [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html), a backend framework for Node.js that can do what the `http` module does and much more (in a simpler, faster and more readable way).

Practically speaking, what can we do with a web server like `http` or `Express`? All the magic that is needed so we can successfully get what we want from an application:

- Get and store data that comes from the frontend
- Make API calls to other services
- Secure data that comes from both the frontend and the database
- Any other type of calculation or business logic

The following course gives a great introduction to the package:
