# SQL injection

Some SQL clients accept input from the user to construct queries.
A malicious user can tweak the input to acquire more information from the database or
to destroy the database (literally!). See [this Demo program](https://github.com/pixel2code/databases/blob/master/Week3/sql-injection.js) `sql-injection.js` in the `Week3` folder.

Consider the following query `SELECT name, salary FROM employees where id = X`.

## Injection to get more information

```sql
/* If X is `101 OR 1=1`, then the query returns all records because 1=1 is always true */
SELECT name, salary FROM employees where id = 101 OR 1=1;
```

## Injection to destroy the database

```sql
/* If X is `101; DROP database mydb`, then the query will delete the entire database */
SELECT name, salary FROM employees where id = 101; DROP database mydb;
```

To prevent SQL injection you have to use prepared statements. The diagram below summarizes nicely how prepared statements work:

With prepared statements, we instruct the database to treat certain parts of a query only as a string and nothing else. Even if the string is a valid command it will not be evaluated or executed. The syntax for prepared statements is:

Make sure that the database already contains the `employees` table
```sql
PREPARE example FROM 'SELECT name, salary FROM employees where id = ?';
SET @id = 5;
EXECUTE example USING @id
```

If you try to provide an extra command in the input `set @id='2; show tables'`, it will not be executed.
