# API's

Whenever we talk about software development, we'll inevitably end up talking about `Application Programming Interfaces`, or APIs for short. But what is all the fuss about?

The first thing we need to understand is that API means different things to different people. Some people use it to refer to a complete application (frontend + backend), others use it to only refer to the server, or there's even people who use it to refer to any part of an application (i.e. "frontend API"/"server API")

For our purposes it's useful to stick to one definition, while keeping in mind that others will use it differently. Here's the definition we'll use:

```markdown
An Application Programming Interface (API) is an interface to an application. It's the point of connection for any other application, in order to communicate with it. The API defines the terms of how to connect to it.
```

You can think of an API as a wall socket:

As you can see on the image, the wall socket has a certain shape. This shape defines in what way something can connect to it. If you were to use a plug that had a different shape, it would never fit and thus never be able to connect. But if you had a plug that was in the correct shape, you got plug it in and proceed to connect to whatever is behind the socket (which in this case is the service of electricity).

In a way, you could say that an API is the frontend to an application. It's similar to the frontend part of a website. The biggest difference is, however, that instead of giving a way for human users to interact with it, an API gives a way for other applications to interact with it.

Have a look at this video by [Stas](https://github.com/Stasel) that explains the theoretical side of what an API is:

## Public/private APIs

There are 2 different types of APIs: **public** and **private** APIs.

An API is **public** when software companies publish parts of their software to be freely used by developers from the outside world. If you were to integrate the Facebook API as a login system in your application, you would be using their API as a public API.

Conversely, there are also **private** APIs: software companies that grant access to parts of their backend applications to internal developers only, in order to develop new services to be used either internally or for the outside world.

In reality, there are way more private than public APIs. This is because it's usually in the company's best interest to keep their code base hidden from the public eye: it would be like giving your secret recipe away for free.

Keep this in mind: in the real world **programming is only a means to serving a business end**. In this course you're learning how to program, to make nice-looking, well-functioning applications. However, this is always done within a business context. This is to say: does this software lead to making more money/gaining more popularity/or the achievement of any other business goal?

## Connecting with APIs

A big part of what applications do is **moving data from one place to another**. Let's say you are on our website and feel like donating some money. First of all, that's very nice of you! You head out to the website and click on the donate button. You type in the amount and click on "donate". You'll notice you immediately get redirected to a different website, namely checkout.stripe.com. How did Stripe know how to do this?

It's because the website sends a **HTTP Request** to Stripe. The request basically says "Hey Stripe, some user from the site wants to make a digital payment, can you handle that?". As a response Stripe answers "Of course, send the user to this specific URL and I'll take it from there!".

> Anytime a request to an API is made this is called a `HTTP Request`. However, in practice people use different terms for the same thing. Synonyms for `HTTP Request` are `API call/request`, `Network call/request`, `Web request/call` or`HTTP call`. Which do you prefer?

A HTTP Request has to be made using a special method. The browser gives us two of them: `XMLHttpRequest` and `Fetch API`. `XMLHttpRequest` (or XHR for short) is the older, more verbose method. It looks like this:

```js
// 1. Create a new XMLHttpRequest object
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

// 2. Configure it: GET-request for the URL /article/.../load
xhr.open('GET', '/article/xmlhttprequest/example/load');

// 3. Send the request over the network
xhr.send();

// 4. This will be called after the response is received
xhr.onload = function() {
  if (xhr.status != 200) {
    // analyze HTTP status of the response
    alert(`Error ${xhr.status}: ${xhr.statusText}`); // e.g. 404: Not Found
  } else {
    // show the result
    alert(`Done, got ${xhr.response.length} bytes`); // response is the server
  }
};

xhr.onprogress = function(event) {
  if (event.lengthComputable) {
    alert(`Received ${event.loaded} of ${event.total} bytes`);
  } else {
    alert(`Received ${event.loaded} bytes`); // no Content-Length
  }
};

xhr.onerror = function() {
  alert('Request failed');
};
```

This way of making HTTP Requests is outdated (and not recommended to use), but it's good to be aware of it as you might still see it in old code bases.

The newer way of making HTTP Requests involves using the `Fetch API`. You can read more about this in our [fetch](./fetch.md) section.
